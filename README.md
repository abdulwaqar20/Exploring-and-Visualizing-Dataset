# Task 1:Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

## Objective
The objective of this task is to load, inspect, and explore a dataset using basic data analysis and visualization techniques. The goal is to understand feature distributions, relationships, and patterns through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

---

## Dataset Used
- **Name:** Iris Dataset  
- **Source:** Seaborn built-in dataset  
- **Total Samples:** 150  
- **Features:**  
  - sepal_length  
  - sepal_width  
  - petal_length  
  - petal_width  
- **Target Variable:** species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

---

## Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Methods Applied
- Data loading and inspection using pandas  
- Dataset structure analysis using `.info()` and `.head()`  
- Descriptive statistics using `.describe()`  
- Data visualization techniques:
  - Scatter plots
  - Histograms
  - Box plots

---

## Model Training
No machine learning model was trained in this task.  
This task focuses only on exploratory data analysis (EDA) as per the task
requirements.

---

## Key Findings
- The dataset contains no missing values.
- Sepal features provide limited separation between species.
- Petal features show strong separation among species.
- Petal length is a highly discriminative feature.
- The dataset is suitable for future classification tasks.

## Conclusion
This task provided hands-on experience with data inspection, statistical analysis, and visualization. Exploratory data analysis helped uncover meaningful patterns and insights from the Iris dataset without applying any machine learning models.
